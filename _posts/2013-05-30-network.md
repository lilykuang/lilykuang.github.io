##Brief Description
Network is played on an 8-by-8 board. There are two players, "Black" and "White." Each player has ten chips of its own color to place on the board. White moves first. It was implemented the minimax algorithm for searching game trees. A game tree is a mapping of all possible moves you can make, and all possible responses by the opponent, and all possible responses, and so on to a specified "search depth."
